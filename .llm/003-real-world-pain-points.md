## ðŸŒ± What Inspired Lychee: Real-World Pain Points

### ðŸ§  Context Switching at Doisdados

At Doisdados, the monorepo setup has exposed key friction points:

- **Manual Service Creation**: Spinning up a new service means repeating boilerplate steps, configuring environments, and wiring up integrationsâ€”tedious and error-prone.
- **Type Sharing Nightmares**: Sharing types across Python and TypeScript often leads to duplication, drift, and bugs. Developers waste time syncing definitions manually.
- **Tooling Fragmentation**: Each service has its own dev server, build system, and runtime quirks. Switching between them breaks flow and increases cognitive load.

Lychee solves this by offering **template-based service scaffolding**, **contract-driven type generation**, and **a unified CLI** that abstracts away the mess.

### ðŸ§ª Everyday Developer Frustrations

- **"Works on my machine" Syndrome**: Missing environment variables, mismatched Python/Node versions, and undocumented setup steps derail onboarding and collaboration.
- **Inconsistent Dev Environments**: Developers spend hours replicating setups instead of writing code.

Lychee introduces:

- âœ… **Environment Normalization**: Automatically detects and syncs required versions of runtimes and dependencies.
- ðŸ“¦ **Project Templates**: Create services from production-ready blueprints with built-in schema sync, logging, and health checks.
- ðŸ§° **One-Command Setup**: `lychee onboard` sets up everythingâ€”dependencies, databases, environment variables, and even mock data.

### ðŸ”— Shared Types & Schema Producers

Lycheeâ€™s schema-first approach becomes even more powerful when integrated with tools like Prisma:

- **Schema Producers**: Services can act as producers of shared types. For example, a database schema defined in Prisma can be converted to JSON Schema, then translated into Zod (TypeScript), Pydantic (Python), etc.
- **Centralized Type Distribution**: Generated types can be published as packages (e.g., `@acme/shared-types`) or exposed via static directories, depending on project needs.
- **Automatic Syncing**: Lychee watches for changes in source schemas and regenerates downstream types instantly.

This turns your monorepo into a **living, breathing ecosystem**, where contracts are always up-to-date and services speak the same languageâ€”regardless of the language theyâ€™re written in.

## ðŸ§­ Future Directions & Enhancements

Here are some ideas to push Lychee even further:

### ðŸ”Œ Plugin Ecosystem

- Community-built plugins for languages like Go, Rust, and Java.
- Integration plugins for tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform.
- Custom hooks for pre/post build, test, and deploy workflows.

### ðŸ“Š Dev Analytics

- Track build times, service health, and schema changes over time.
- Surface bottlenecks and flaky services with actionable insights.

### ðŸ§ª Contract Testing

- Auto-generate contract tests from JSON Schema.
- Validate that services adhere to expected inputs/outputs before runtime.

### ðŸ§  AI-Assisted DX

- Use AI to suggest schema changes, detect breaking changes, and even auto-generate service stubs from schema definitions.

## ðŸ§ƒ Final Thoughts

Lychee isnâ€™t just solving technical problemsâ€”itâ€™s reshaping how teams think about service development. By turning schemas into the backbone of collaboration, and wrapping everything in a delightful CLI experience, it empowers developers to move fast without breaking things.

If youâ€™re building Lychee or pitching it internally, this expanded vision can help rally support and clarify its transformative potential. Want help drafting a README, pitch deck, or onboarding guide next?
