Great, I'll brainstorm some ideas:

- package or service init from project templates

- lychee "primitives" like queues, hooks, kv etc

- docker friendly: full docker integration

- full control over services environment variables

---

These are excellent ideas and they perfectly align with Lychee's core mission of simplifying the developer experience. Let's break down how we can integrate them into the plan and make them even more powerful.

---

### **1. Package and Service Initialization**

This is the cornerstone of a great DX. Lychee won't just copy files; it will intelligently scaffold entire projects and services, integrating them into the monorepo's configuration.

- **Template-driven Scaffolding:** The `lychee add` command will use a central template system. For example, `lychee add service my-new-service --template python-fastapi` would not only create the service's file structure but also automatically add the new service's configuration to the `monorepo.yml` file.
- **Contextual Variables:** The templates will be smart. You'll be able to use variables like `{{service_name}}` or `{{project_path}}` in your template files and even in filenames, which Lychee will replace dynamically. This ensures consistency and reduces manual work.
- **Dependency Installation:** Lychee can even run initial setup commands. When you add a new service, it can automatically run `npm install` or `pip install` within the new service's directory, so it's ready to go immediately.

### **2. Lychee "Primitives"**

This is a fantastic idea that elevates Lychee from a simple manager to a true development framework. By providing built-in primitives, you can standardize common patterns and abstract away complexity.

- **Schema-driven Primitives:** Let's make these primitives work with the schema manager. For a **queue**, you could define the message schema, and Lychee would generate the typed code for both the producer and consumer services.
  - `lychee add queue notification-events`
  - This would generate a `notification-events.schema.json` file.
  - It would also create `pydantic` models for Python and `TypeScript` interfaces, allowing your services to send and receive messages with full type-safety.
- **Built-in Logic:** For a **key-value store**, Lychee could provide a shared client and `get`, `set`, and `delete` methods that are already configured to connect to the store. This makes common tasks trivial for developers.

---

### **3. Full Docker Integration**

Docker is non-negotiable for consistent development and deployment. Lychee's integration should be deep and seamless.

- **Containerized Development:** The `lychee dev` command can run services inside containers using `docker-compose`. This ensures every developer's environment is identical, eliminating "it works on my machine" issues. Lychee would handle the complexities of networking and hot reloading inside the containers.
- **Automated Dockerfile Generation:** When you create a new service from a template, Lychee can automatically generate a best-practice `Dockerfile`. This ensures every service is containerized consistently from the start.
- **Build and Publish:** The `lychee build` command could have a `--platform docker` flag. This would build the Docker images for your services, and a `lychee deploy` command could then push them to a container registry.

### **4. Full Control over Service Environment Variables**

Managing environment variables is a common source of errors. Lychee should provide a clean, layered approach.

- **Configuration Hierarchy:** Environment variables can be defined at multiple levels, with later layers overriding earlier ones:
  1.  **Global:** Variables defined in `monorepo.yml` for all services.
  2.  **Service-specific:** Variables defined for a single service in `monorerepo.yml`.
  3.  **Environment-specific:** Variables defined in `.monorepo/environments/staging.yml`, which would override everything else for that environment.
- **Secrets Management:** For sensitive information like API keys, Lychee can prompt the user to create a `.lychee.env` file in the root directory. This file would never be committed to Git but would be automatically loaded by the `lychee dev` command, keeping secrets out of version control.

These are all excellent ideas that would make Lychee a truly indispensable tool. Which of these concepts would you like to plan out in more detail first?
