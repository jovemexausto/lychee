This is an incredibly detailed and ambitious plan. The level of thought you've put into the Developer Experience (DX) is excellent and genuinely addresses the major pain points of working in a polyglot monorepo. The core philosophy of **"Zero Context Switching"** is a perfect guiding principle, and your proposed solutions, from the unified dashboard to schema-aware hot reloading, are spot-on.

Instead of adding more features, let's refine the plan to build the most impactful parts of the DX first. The key is to establish a "Core DX Loop" that delivers immediate value and can be incrementally built upon.

## Refined Development Workflow: The Core DX Loop

The most critical part of this tool is the `monorepo dev` command. This single entry point will define the developer's day-to-day experience. Let's focus on making this command's initial version as robust and fast as possible.

### Phase 1: The Core Loop (MVP)

This phase focuses on the essential, continuous feedback loop.

1.  **Intelligent Service Orchestration:** The `dev` command will be the brain.

    - It will parse the `lychee.yaml` to understand the dependency graph.
    - It will start services in the correct order, waiting for health checks to pass before starting their dependents.
    - Instead of a complex proxy manager initially, it will use a simple, in-process reverse proxy (perhaps built with `FastAPI` or a lightweight `aiohttp` server) to route traffic to the correct local ports.

2.  **Unified Real-time Dashboard:** This is the most visible part of the DX.

    - We'll use a `Rich`-based Terminal User Interface (TUI) to display the real-time status of all running services.
    - The dashboard will show a progress bar for service startup, and a simple status (`RUNNING`, `STARTING`, `ERROR`) and port for each service.
    - A dedicated section will show schema synchronization status, indicating when types are being generated or if an error occurred.
    - This dashboard will be the single source of truth, so the developer never has to leave the terminal to check what's happening.

3.  **Context-Aware Hot Reloading:** This is the core magic.

    - A file watcher will monitor the project directory for changes.
    - If a schema file (`*.schema.json`) is modified, it will trigger the **schema manager** to regenerate types for all affected services.
    - If a source code file is modified, it will trigger a restart for that specific service.
    - The dashboard will reflect these changes in real-time, showing which services are restarting or rebuilding.

4.  **Integrated Logging:** A simple, yet powerful, logging aggregation.
    - The `dev` command will capture `stdout` and `stderr` from all managed services.
    - These logs will be displayed in a separate, dedicated section of the TUI dashboard, color-coded by service to make them easy to read and debug.

This focused approach ensures that the primary development loop is fast, reliable, and provides an immediate "wow" factor. We'll be able to build on this solid foundation to add features like integrated testing, advanced error correlation, and AI assistance later.

### Next Steps for Implementation

To build this "Core DX Loop," the most critical component is the development server. It will contain the logic for the orchestrator, the dashboard, the file watcher, and the proxy.

With that in mind, I recommend we proceed by writing the **`monorepo.dev.server`** module. This file will be the central hub that orchestrates the entire `monorepo dev` experience, bringing all of the pieces together.
